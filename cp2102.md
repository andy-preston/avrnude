## CP2102 USB/Serial Adaptors

I used [cp210x-cfg](https://github.com/DiUS/cp210x-cfg) running on my PC
to give each CP2012 based adaptor a unique "serial number" which could be
interpreted through the following udev rules:

```
SUBSYSTEMS=="usb", ATTRS{idVendor}=="10c4", ATTRS{idProduct}=="ea60", ATTRS{serial}=="stk500v1", KERNEL=="ttyUSB*", SYMLINK+="stk500v1"
SUBSYSTEMS=="usb", ATTRS{idVendor}=="10c4", ATTRS{idProduct}=="ea60", ATTRS{serial}=="pic32prog", KERNEL=="ttyUSB*", SYMLINK+="pic32prog"
```

This would allow each serial adaptor to have it's own unique `/dev/` node
which would save a lot of trouble on the programming and configuration side
as we wouldn't need to remember that `/dev/ttyUSB0` is the AVR programmer
and `/dev/ttyACM2` is the stlink, etc. We can simply use `/dev/stk500v1` or
`/dev/pic32prog`.

Except that the version of OpenWRT I'm running doesn't have udev installed. :(

+ TODO: check if we CAN run udev on Chaos Calmer
