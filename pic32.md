# Abandoned PIC32 Programmer.

I was using a PIC32 programmer based around
[pic32prog](https://github.com/sergev/pic32prog) and
[Pinguino's Cheap DIY PIC32 Programmer](http://www.pinguino.cc/wiki/index.php?title=Cheap_DIY_PIC32_Programmer&oldid=8136).

In the process of implementing this, I produced a
[package for my version of OpenWRT for pic32prog](https://gitlab.com/edgeeffect/openwrt-pic32prog).
